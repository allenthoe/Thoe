"""
1. For this exercise, we are going to review a previously learned exercise and try
and modify the code so that it is applied in a different way.

Consider the code:

def drawSquare(s):
    for i in range(4):
        sven.forward(s)
        sven.right(90)

This will draw a square of length s.  Rewrite the code below BUT add another
parameter so that you can use anyturtle.  Don't forget to call your function.

* Don't forget to import the turtle module AND create a turtle.
"""


"""
2. Now use this template to create a new function that will draw a regular
triangle.  Think about what angle you would need to turn (a full cirle is 360).
Use 2 parameters.  One for the side length (s) and one for the turtle (anyTurtle)
